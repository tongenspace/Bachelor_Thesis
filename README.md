# Bachelor_Thesis

This repository contains the four main algorithms presented in Hristo Tonchev's bachelor thesis. There are five files, one for each algorithm and a Library file containing functions common to the different algorithms. In order to run one of the algorthms one must also download the Library file, and then place it in the same folder as the other code.
